Recipe 2.1
  - I skipped the git since I think it might just be a stumbling block and, while a useful, necessary skill,
  can be acquired elsewhere.
  - First step is to update the pom.xml in webapp
    -> In addition to the code from the chapter, the javax.servlet dependency requires the version & scope
      <version>3.0.1</version>
      <scope>provided</scope>
