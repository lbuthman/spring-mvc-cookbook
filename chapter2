Recipe 1
  - I skipped the git since I think it might just be a stumbling block and, while a useful, necessary skill,
  can be acquired elsewhere.
  - First step is to update the pom.xml in webapp
    -> In addition to the code from the chapter, the javax.servlet dependency requires the version & scope
      <version>3.0.1</version>
      <scope>provided</scope>
  - If you skip the pulling from git, there are classes in the core module that need to be created. It was
  interesting adding them manually to get a feel for the current state of the app and what kind of data we
  will be using.
  - Make sure the pom.xml, dispatcher-context, and web.xml files get updated. There are several changes to 
  be aware of.
  - To launch http://localhost:8080/portal/info/server, I had to use
    -> http://localhost:8080/cloudstreetmarket-webapp/info/server
    -> use http://localhost:8080/portal/info/server for Run | Edit configuration | url for open browser
  - DispatchSeverlet is configured in the web.xml
