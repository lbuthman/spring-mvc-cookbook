Starting over in IntelliJ

(skipped Recipe 1 and 2)

Recipe 3
  - there are two projects in this recipe, one for CloudStreetMarket and one for ZipCloud. In Eclipse, these
  can coexist in the window, but IntelliJ needs separate windows for each project
  
  - create submodules (fail)
    
Recipe 4
  - step 5 -> had to update Maven project to remove red x warning
    -- right click, Maven - Update Project
    
  - step 8 -> got an error when trying to Add and Remove
    -- used this solution and it worked fine
