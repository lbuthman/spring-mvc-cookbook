Starting over in IntelliJ

(skipped Recipe 1 and 2)

Recipe 3
  - right click top directory | New | Module | Maven (leave Create from archtype unchecked) | Next
  - add GroupId, ArtifactId and Version
  - for Module name, I used cloudstreetmarket-parent | finish
  - I clicked Enable-Auto Import when asked by IntelliJ
  - add the XML listed in the book
  
  - create submodules (fail)
    
Recipe 4
  - step 5 -> had to update Maven project to remove red x warning
    -- right click, Maven - Update Project
    
  - step 8 -> got an error when trying to Add and Remove
