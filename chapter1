Starting over in IntelliJ

Recipe 1
  - I tried to use my existing Eclipse installation, but it was missing Maven
    -> make sure Eclipse is EE version, otherwise Maven won't be there

Recipe 2
  - the path for my java version was Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_121.jdk

Recipe 3
  - step 7.3 -> it's not under Window, it's the normal preferences [ commanad + , ]

  - step 7.5 -> this step will give you problems because tomcat 8.0 expected instead of 8.5.x
  follow the steps here to fix it
