Starting over in IntelliJ

(skipped Recipe 1 and 2)

Recipe 3
  - there are two projects in this recipe, one for CloudStreetMarket and one for ZipCloud. In Eclipse, these
  can coexist in the window, but IntelliJ needs separate windows for each project.
  - IntelliJ wizard doesn't configure packaging and name, so add them in the pom.xml
  - After each change to the pom.xml, there will be a prompt to Import Changes. Just click it :)
  - Note: the SNAPSHOT defaults to 1.0 even when putting 0.0.1. I'm imaging this is not going to be a problem, as
  long as I stay consistent with 1.0
    
Recipe 4
  - The zipcloud-parent pom.xml in the Chapter 1 source code is missing the settings we put in <configuration>
  tags during the previous Recipe. The book says you should already have everything in <build> from Recipe 3, so
  just a warning if you decide to copy everything, the pom.xml file is flawed in <build><configuration>.

  - step 5 -> had to update Maven project to remove red x warning
    -- right click, Maven - Update Project
    
  - step 8 -> got an error when trying to Add and Remove
    -- used this solution and it worked fine
