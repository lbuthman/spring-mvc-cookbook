Starting over in IntelliJ

(skipped Recipe 1 and 2)

Recipe 3
  - there are two projects in this recipe, one for CloudStreetMarket and one for ZipCloud. In Eclipse, these
  can coexist in the window, but IntelliJ needs separate windows for each project.
  - IntelliJ wizard doesn't configure packaging and name, so add them in the pom.xml
  - After each change to the pom.xml, there will be a prompt to Import Changes. Just click it :)
  - Note: the SNAPSHOT defaults to 1.0 even when putting 0.0.1. I'm imaging this is not going to be a problem, as
  long as I stay consistent with 1.0
    
Recipe 4
  - The zipcloud-parent pom.xml in the Chapter 1 source code is missing the settings we put in <configuration>
  tags during the previous Recipe. The book says you should already have everything in <build> from Recipe 3, so
  just a warning if you decide to copy everything, the pom.xml file is flawed in <build><configuration>.
  - Once you add the dependencies in the api and webapp pom.xml's, you will get an error. The pom.xml's have a
  dependency on edu.zipcloud and that is not available. I just commented it out because I'm not sure how to
  resolve this.
  - When it's time to add Tomcat use the steps here
    -> http://geekabyte.blogspot.com/2015/07/how-to-create-war-files-with-intellij.html
  except, do not use exploaded-war. For the Application context, use /cloudstreetmarket-api and 
  /cloudstreetmarket-webapp
  - On the Server tab, change the URL to http://localhost:8080/cloudstreetmarket-webapp/index.html. The one in
  the book uses http://localhost:8080/portal/index.html and I'm not sure how that happens. Might be due to how
  the projects are grouped together in Eclipse.
